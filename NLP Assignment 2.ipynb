    "# Ans:\n",
    "# 1. Corpora refer to large and structured collections of text, often used as a dataset for linguistic analysis and natural language \n",
    "# processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Tokens are individual units or elements obtained after tokenizing a text. They can be words, characters, or subwords, depending on\n",
    "# the tokenization strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams are types of n-grams. Unigrams refer to single words, bigrams refer to pairs of consecutive words, \n",
    "# and trigrams refer to triplets of consecutive words.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. N-grams can be generated from text by splitting the text into chunks of n consecutive words. Each chunk represents an n-gram.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or root form, known as the lemma. It helps to normalize words by \n",
    "# considering their morphological variants and brings them to a common form.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Stemming is a process of reducing words to their base form by removing suffixes or prefixes. It is a simpler and more heuristic-based\n",
    "# approach compared to lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is the process of assigning grammatical labels (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to words in a \n",
    "# sentence. It helps in understanding the syntactic structure and meaning of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Chunking, also known as shallow parsing, involves grouping words into meaningful chunks or phrases based on their syntactic structure.\n",
    "# It helps in identifying noun phrases, verb phrases, etc., in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. Noun Phrase (NP) chunking is a type of chunking that specifically focuses on identifying and extracting noun phrases from a sentence.\n",
    "# It helps in extracting meaningful information about entities and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of identifying and classifying named entities such as names of persons, \n",
    "# organizations, locations, etc., in text. It helps in extracting important entities and their relationships from unstructured text data."
